        <p>Hello! My name is Fatima Puro and I am from Venezuela. I am married to Rovy and we have four children. I love my job and spending time with my family and friends. There are two things I really enjoy doing and they are reading and cross-stitching. One of my dreams is to be able to visit all the beautiful places that exist in my country. </p>
